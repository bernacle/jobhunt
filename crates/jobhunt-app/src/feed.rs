//! The Today feed: the few recommendations that are *new to the person*,
//! and the ones they already looked at that changed in a way that matters.
//!
//! The shortlist ([`crate::shortlist`]) answers "what is worth my time?"
//! every time it is asked, so the same jobs come back until the person acts
//! on them. The feed answers "what is worth my time *that I haven't dealt
//! with*?", so a visit can end: once the few items are saved, rejected,
//! marked applied or put aside, the person is caught up, and nothing
//! mediocre takes their place.
//!
//! It is built from the same ranking (tiers, gates, briefs:
//! [`jobhunt_ranking`]); only the selection is its own:
//!
//! | The person's state | On the feed |
//! | --- | --- |
//! | never acted on it, never shown it | **new** |
//! | never acted on it, first shown less than [`HOLD_HOURS`] ago | **new** (still; reloading does not make it vanish) |
//! | never acted on it, shown longer ago | passed over (counted, not shown) |
//! | looked at / put aside ("not now") / saved | only if it **changed** materially since |
//! | rejected, applied, interviewing, offer, closed, ineligible | never (the ranking gate excludes it) |
//!
//! Only strong fits and jobs worth reviewing are candidates: a feed with
//! nothing new is *caught up*, not padded with maybes.
//!
//! A material change is one the job's history records (discovery's
//! UPDATED / REOPENED events, see [`jobhunt_jobs::lifecycle`]) in a field
//! that changes whether someone would want or could take the job: pay
//! published or changed, location or remote policy, work authorization,
//! employment type, or a closed job reopening. Edits to the title, the
//! description or links do not bring a job back. A resurfaced job stays for
//! [`HOLD_HOURS`] too, and is never brought back twice for the same change.
//!
//! Where the store keeps per-person search state (the cloud), what the
//! feed showed is remembered; locally it is not, so there "new" simply
//! means not acted on yet.
