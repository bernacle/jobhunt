// JobHunt Cloud on Railway (Infrastructure as Code).
//
// Two images (the repository's Dockerfile for the Rust binary,
// apps/web/Dockerfile for the web app), six resources:
//
//   Postgres              the database (shared corpus + private data)
//   api                   `narrow server`: HTTP API and hosted MCP; runs
//                         `narrow migrate` before each deploy
//   web                   the web app (Next.js), which calls `api` over
//                         Railway's private network
//   worker-discovery      cron: reads the sources that are due
//   worker-verification   cron: re-verifies the jobs that matter
//   worker-notify         cron: emails strong new recommendations
//
// Secrets are declared with preserve(): set them once in the dashboard or
// with `railway variable set KEY=… -s api` (and seal them); applying this
// file never overwrites or deletes them. See README.md, "JobHunt Cloud on
// Railway", for every variable and the first deploy.
//
//   npm install            # the `railway` package (package.json)
