# JobHunt Cloud

JobHunt Cloud is the local product, hosted. It keeps discovering and
verifying opportunities while your laptop is closed, gives you an account
your laptop syncs with, and serves the same use cases over an HTTP API and
a hosted MCP endpoint. It is not a second product: discovery, verification,
eligibility, ranking, taste, the profile rules and the evidence policy are
the same code the `jobhunt` command runs, reached through the same
application layer.

```

- `jobhunt-app`'s `App` holds an `Arc<dyn Store>`. Locally that is the
  SQLite file; in the cloud each request gets an `App` over
  `PgStore::for_user(account)`, a view of Postgres bound to one account.
  Use cases do not know which one they run on.
- `jobhunt-storage::postgres` implements every repository trait
  (`JobRepository`, `VerificationRepository`, `EligibilityRepository`,
  `FeedbackRepository`, `RankingRepository`, `ProfileRepository`). A shared
  contract suite runs the same behavior against SQLite and a real Postgres,
  including a whole scenario whose rankings must come out identical.
- `jobhunt-cloud` adds only what hosting needs: configuration, auth, the
  API, hosted MCP, workers, usage events and request tracing.
- Nothing requires an LLM: discovery, verification, eligibility and
  ranking are deterministic, and no AI API key is used.

## Processes

One binary (`jobhunt`), one Docker image, several modes:

| Command | Railway service | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `jobhunt server` | `api` | HTTP API, hosted MCP, `/health`, `/ready` |
| `jobhunt migrate` | `api` pre-deploy | applies pending migrations, exits |
| `jobhunt worker discovery` | `worker-discovery` (cron) | reads the sources that are due, exits |
| `jobhunt worker verification` | `worker-verification` (cron) | re-verifies jobs that matter, exits |
| `jobhunt admin status` / `reencrypt` | (run by an operator) | configuration report, schedule, usage; key rotation |

The cloud modes read their configuration from environment variables
([reference](#configuration-reference)); they never read the local config
file or database. They log JSON to stderr.

No Kubernetes, message queue, Redis or browser worker: Postgres is the
database and the only coordination mechanism, and Railway's cron runs the
workers.

## Data: shared corpus and private data

| Shared (one copy for everyone) | Private (per account) |
| --- | --- |
| `jobs` (canonical postings, lifecycle status, opportunity) | `profiles`, `profile_entities` (every profile record, encrypted) |
| `job_events` (NEW / UPDATED / CLOSED / REOPENED history) | `profile_events` (history; details encrypted) |
| `job_evidence` (cross-source identity) | `feedback` (reasons encrypted) |
| `discovery_runs`, `source_scans` (validators, counts) | `eligibility_decisions` (encrypted; they depend on the profile) |
| `job_verifications` (listing facts do not depend on who asked) | `rankings` (encrypted) |
| `source_schedule`, `verification_leases`, `worker_runs` | `user_opportunities` (what shortlists showed), `user_state` |
| | `users`, `user_identities`, `api_tokens` (hashed) |
| | `usage_events` (analytics, kept apart) |

- A Greenhouse job is discovered, stored and verified once, however many
  people it concerns. Each person's eligibility and ranking of it are
  computed against their own profile and stored under their account, so
  the same shared job can be eligible for one person and not another
  (tested).
- Every private query is bound to an account: `PgUserStore` has no method
  that reads private data without its account id. Deleting an account
  (`DELETE /api/v1/account`) deletes all of it; shared jobs stay.
- Identifiers keep the application's formats (`job_…`, `opp_…`, `clm_…`,
  `fb_…`, `usr_…`) with the `"C"` collation, so ordering matches SQLite.
  Every person's profile keeps the local profile id: records have the same
  ids on the laptop and in the cloud, which is what makes sync exact.
- Timestamps are `timestamptz` (microseconds, like the local store);
  structured values that are read whole are `jsonb` (locations,
  compensation, job history snapshots, verification records); private
  values are `bytea` ciphertext.

## Accounts and authentication

JobHunt keeps no passwords and no personal details of an account. People
sign in with an **OpenID Connect provider**. The deployment uses **WorkOS
AuthKit**: it has the device authorization grant the CLI uses, JWT
access tokens bound to a resource (RFC 8707), refresh tokens, and OAuth
for MCP clients with dynamic client registration. Nothing in the code is
specific to it; Auth0, Okta, Zitadel and Keycloak work through the same
settings. An account is an internal id (`usr_<32 hex>`) linked to the
`(issuer, subject)` of the provider's tokens.

- **Access tokens** (JWTs) are verified against the issuer's published
  keys (OpenID discovery, else RFC 8414 authorization server metadata,
  else `JOBHUNT_OIDC_JWKS_URL`; keys cached 10 minutes, and an unknown key
  id triggers one rate-limited refresh, for key rotation). Only asymmetric
  algorithms are accepted; the issuer (exactly as configured: a trailing
  slash matters), the audience (one of `JOBHUNT_OIDC_AUDIENCE`) and the
  expiry are checked (60 s leeway). The first valid token of an identity
  creates its account.
- **Personal access tokens** (`jh_pat_…`, 256 random bits) are for MCP
  clients and scripts without OAuth. They expire (default 90 days, at most
  365), are listed without their secret, and are revocable. Only their
  SHA-256 digest is stored.
- **Log out everywhere** (`jobhunt logout --everywhere`,
  `POST /api/v1/account/logout`) refuses every token issued before that
  moment and revokes every personal access token; it takes effect within
  30 seconds on every replica.
- A **development mode** (`JOBHUNT_AUTH_MODE=dev`, HS256 tokens minted by
  `POST /api/v1/auth/dev-token`) exists for local development and tests;
  the server refuses to start with it in production.

Internally a request becomes a `Principal { user, method }`; domain code
never sees tokens or the provider.

### The CLI

```bash
jobhunt login --server https://jobhunt.example.com   # opens a device code sign-in
jobhunt login --token < token.txt                    # a personal access token (or JOBHUNT_TOKEN)
jobhunt account                                      # account and sync state
jobhunt logout [--everywhere]
jobhunt token create "Claude Desktop" --days 30      # prints the secret once
jobhunt token list | jobhunt token revoke tok_…
```

`login` uses the OAuth 2.0 device authorization grant (RFC 8628): it
prints a URL and a code, you confirm in the browser, and the CLI receives
tokens. You never paste a long-lived secret into a config file. The
session is stored in the system keychain on macOS and Windows, and in an
owner-only file (`0600` in a `0700` directory under the data directory)
elsewhere, or where `JOBHUNT_CREDENTIALS_FILE` says. Access tokens are
refreshed with the refresh token when they are about to expire; `logout`
revokes the refresh token at the provider (when it has a revocation
endpoint) and deletes the session. `jobhunt doctor` says where the session
is stored and whether there is one, never its tokens.

## Encryption

| Layer | What | How |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Transport | clients ↔ API | HTTPS at Railway's edge; the CLI refuses plain `http` except to localhost |
| Transport | services ↔ Postgres | Railway's private network (WireGuard-encrypted) |
| Application | every profile record (resume text, experiences, claims, contacts, preferences, statements), profile history details, feedback reasons, eligibility decisions, rankings | AES-256-GCM (RustCrypto `aes-gcm`) before the value reaches Postgres |
| Infrastructure | the Postgres volume, backups | as provided by Railway; Railway's documentation does not state volume encryption at rest, which is why private data is encrypted by the application |
| Hashing | personal access tokens | SHA-256 digest only |

Application encryption (`jobhunt_storage::postgres::crypto`):

- Keys come from `JOBHUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEYS`, never from code:
  `<key id>:<base64 of 32 random bytes>`, comma-separated. Generate one with
  `openssl rand -base64 32`. The first key encrypts; every listed key
  decrypts.
- A sealed value is `version | key id | 96-bit random nonce | ciphertext
  and tag`, so it names the key it needs.
- The associated data binds each value to its table, account and record
  (`profile_entities|usr_…|prof_…|claim|clm_…`): a ciphertext copied into
  another account's row, or onto another record, fails to decrypt instead
  of being read (tested).
- **Rotation**: add a new key *first* (`k2:…,k1:…`), redeploy, run
  `jobhunt admin reencrypt` (idempotent; safe while serving), then remove
  the old key.
- Plain columns are only what queries need: ids, states, timestamps, a
  job's title and company on feedback (public facts about the job), and
  digests.
- Lose the keys and the private data is unreadable: keep them in a
  password manager as well as in Railway's sealed variables.

## HTTP API

Versioned under `/api/v1`. Every endpoint is one use case for the
authenticated account and answers with the same view the MCP tool of the
same name returns (`SearchResults`, `JobDetail`, `VerificationReport`,
`FeedbackResult`, `ProfileView`, `PreferenceUpdateResult`, `PipelineView`,
`ApplicationContext`, `StateExport`). Request bodies reuse the MCP tools'
argument types, and reject unknown fields.

| Method | Path | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GET | `/health` | liveness (no dependencies) |
| GET | `/ready` | Postgres reachable and every migration applied (503 otherwise); never checks job boards |
| GET | `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource[/mcp]` | RFC 9728 metadata for MCP clients |
| GET | `/api/v1/auth/config` | how to sign in (issuer, CLI client id, device endpoints) |
| GET / DELETE | `/api/v1/account` | the account and its cloud state / delete it and all its data |
| POST | `/api/v1/account/logout` | revoke every session and token |
| GET, POST / DELETE | `/api/v1/tokens`, `/api/v1/tokens/{id}` | personal access tokens |
| POST | `/api/v1/sync/pull`, `/api/v1/sync/push` | [sync](#sync) |
| POST | `/api/v1/search` | the shortlist (`search_jobs` arguments) |
| GET | `/api/v1/opportunities/{id}` | details (`?include_sources`, `?full_description`) |
| POST | `/api/v1/opportunities/{id}/verify` | ask the sources now (`{"force": bool}`) |
| POST | `/api/v1/opportunities/{id}/feedback` | `{"action": "save" \| "reject" \| "applied" \| …, "reason"}` |
| GET | `/api/v1/opportunities/{id}/application-context` | usable evidence (`?include_contact_details`) |
| GET | `/api/v1/profile` | the profile, never contact details |
| POST | `/api/v1/preferences` | `update_preferences` arguments |
| GET | `/api/v1/pipeline` | `?include_rejected` |
| GET | `/api/v1/export` | the portable `jobhunt.state` file |

Errors are always `{"error": {"code", "message", "hint"}}` with the stable
codes the CLI and MCP use (`unknown_opportunity` 404, `ambiguous_id` 409,
`no_profile` 409, `conflict` 409, `invalid_arguments` 400,
`invalid_preference` 422, `source_unavailable` 503, …) plus
`unauthenticated` (401, with a `WWW-Authenticate` challenge naming the
resource metadata), `invalid_request` (malformed body or query),
`invalid_sync` (422), `not_found` and `internal_error`. Internal causes are
logged, never returned. Every answer has an `x-request-id`.

Searches in the cloud never read job boards (discovery is the workers'
job); they rank the shared corpus for the account and verify their best
candidates when needed. Verifications are shared, so a job verified for
one person minutes ago is reused for the next.

## Hosted MCP

`/mcp` serves the local MCP server's tools (same names, descriptions,
input and output schemas, structured content and error codes) over the
Streamable HTTP transport of the official Rust SDK (`rmcp` 3.4), for
remote clients such as ChatGPT or Claude's connectors.

- Every request must carry a bearer token (OAuth access token or personal
  access token). Without one the server answers 401 with
  `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata=".../.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp"`,
  which MCP clients follow to the authorization server (RFC 9728).
- Each tool call builds the application for the authenticated account;
  there is no tool, argument or session through which another account's
  data can be reached (tested with two accounts).
- The transport is stateless (no in-memory MCP sessions; the `2026-07-28`
  protocol has none), so any replica answers any request.
- `Host` is checked against `JOBHUNT_PUBLIC_URL`, and `Origin` against
  `JOBHUNT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` when set.
- The evidence policy is unchanged: `get_profile` never includes name or
  contacts, `prepare_application_context` only usable evidence, contacts
  only when asked.

## Sync

`jobhunt sync` merges this machine's state with the account's.

What syncs: the **profile** (every record: basics, resume documents,
experiences, projects, education, skills, claims with their confirm/reject
decisions, preferences, statements) and **feedback** (save, reject,
applied, interview, offer, like, dislike, unsave, with reasons). The
pipeline and learned taste are folded from feedback, so they follow.
"Seen" marks stay local. Jobs are not copied wholesale: a pull brings the
source records your feedback and cloud recommendations refer to, with
their latest verification, so they work offline; pushing feedback about a
job the cloud has never seen brings that job along (stored as
`origin = 'sync'` and verified first by the verification worker before it
can be recommended to anyone).

### Protocol

- The cloud stores each profile record as an entity with a **version**
  (incremented by every change, deletions are tombstones) and every
  private change takes the next value of the account's **change
  sequence** (under the account row's lock, so it is gap-free in commit
  order).
- **Pull** (`POST /api/v1/sync/pull {protocol, cursor}`) returns, from one
  consistent snapshot, every entity and feedback event changed after the
  cursor, the jobs and verifications they need, and the new cursor.
- **Push** (`POST /api/v1/sync/push`) sends entity mutations, each "based
  on version N", plus feedback and jobs. It is **compare-and-set, all or
  nothing**: if any entity changed since its base, nothing is applied and
  the current versions come back; the resulting profile must be
  consistent (every reference resolves) or the push is refused. A push
  that already landed (a retry after a lost answer) is recognized by its
  content and changes nothing: sync is idempotent.
- The client keeps, per entity, the last cloud version it agreed with (the
  *base*), the cursor, and which feedback the cloud has, in its own SQLite
  tables. Nothing else about the local product changes.

### Conflict semantics

Each record is decided on its own, three ways (base, here, cloud) — never
"last writer wins" for the whole profile:

| Here | Cloud | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| unchanged | changed | the cloud's version is applied here |
| changed | unchanged | this version is pushed |
| changed | changed identically | nothing to do |
| changed | changed, different fields | merged field by field and pushed (timestamps take the later one; edited-field lists and parser notes are united) |
| changed | changed, **same field differently** | **conflict** |
| edited | deleted (or the reverse) | **conflict** |

A conflict overwrites nothing: this machine keeps its version and does not
push it, the cloud keeps its own, and `jobhunt sync` lists it with both
sides ("the claim was decided differently here and in the cloud (confirmed
vs rejected)"). It stays until you choose:

```bash
jobhunt sync --keep local                  # every conflict: this machine's version wins
jobhunt sync --keep cloud --record clm_…   # one record: the cloud's version wins
jobhunt sync --status                      # where sync stands (offline)
```

Confirmed or rejected claims, explicit preferences and statements, and
feedback therefore never disappear silently. Feedback cannot conflict:
events are immutable with stable ids and merge by union. If merging would
leave the profile inconsistent (a claim about an experience deleted
elsewhere), the sync stops with a message and changes nothing.

### Offline first

Only `login`, `logout`, `account`, `sync` and `token` use the network to
reach the cloud. `find --offline`, `show`, `profile`, `claims`,
`preferences`, feedback and everything else work on the local database
whether the cloud is reachable or not. When it is not, `sync` fails with
`cloud_unavailable` ("could not reach JobHunt Cloud at …") and changes
nothing; changes made meanwhile sync next time (tested). The state file
(`jobhunt export`) remains the portable backup, locally and via
`GET /api/v1/export`.

## Scheduled discovery

`jobhunt worker discovery` (a Railway cron, every 30 minutes by default)
reads the corpus configured in `deploy/cloud.toml` (`JOBHUNT_CONFIG`):

1. registers the configured sources in `source_schedule` (new ones are due
   now; removed ones are disabled, their jobs and history kept);
2. recomputes tiers: a source is **active** when someone gave feedback on,
   or was recommended, one of its jobs in the last 14 days;
3. claims due sources (leases, see below) in batches and runs the
   **same discovery pipeline** as `jobhunt find`: conditional requests
   (ETags) so unchanged boards answer "not modified", the lifecycle
   (NEW / UPDATED / CLOSED / REOPENED, with history), completeness rules
   before closing, cross-source grouping;
4. records each source's outcome and next due time.

Cadence (configurable): active sources every 3 hours
(`JOBHUNT_DISCOVERY_ACTIVE_HOURS`), others every 12 hours
(`JOBHUNT_DISCOVERY_NORMAL_HOURS`); a failing source is retried after
1 hour, then 2, 4, 8, … hours, capped at 48 hours
(`JOBHUNT_DISCOVERY_MAX_BACKOFF_HOURS`), and returns to its tier's
interval after its next success. A run stops claiming after 20
minutes (`--budget-minutes`). Each source is read once for everyone: no
per-user crawling, no LLM, no browser.

## Scheduled verification

`jobhunt worker verification` (hourly by default) re-verifies up to
`JOBHUNT_VERIFY_BATCH` (100) open jobs whose last attempt is older than
the freshness window (`[verification] fresh_hours`, 24 h), most important
first:

1. in someone's pipeline (saved, applied, interviewing, offer);
2. recommended to someone in the last 7 days;
3. brought by a person's sync and never seen by cloud discovery;
4. discovered in the last 48 hours.

Other jobs are not verified in the background (they are verified when a
search makes them a candidate). It uses the product's verification
service and freshness policy, so a changed listing is UPDATED and a
reappearing one REOPENED exactly as locally.

Rankings are not precomputed: a search ranks for the person on request,
reusing stored eligibility decisions and rankings whose inputs (profile
revision, taste digest, record content, verification, rules versions) are
unchanged; any shared job change is a new cache key, so nothing stale is
served. Per-person search state (`user_opportunities`: first and last
shown, tier, times shown; `user_state`: last sync, last shortlist, the
profile revision it used, a notification cursor) is what "new since you
last looked" and notifications (BRU-295) build on.

## Coordination and locking

Postgres is the only coordination mechanism; nothing relies on
process-local state across instances.

| Concern | Mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Migrations from several instances | sqlx's migration advisory lock (tested with concurrent `migrate`) |
| Two discovery workers | `UPDATE … FROM (… FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED)` leases per source; a dead worker's lease expires (15 min) and is taken over; outcomes are only recorded by the lease holder |
| Two verification workers | `verification_leases` claimed with one upsert that only takes free or expired leases |
| A scan and a verification of the same source | a transaction-scoped advisory lock per source (SQLite's `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` serialized all writers; Postgres serializes only what conflicts) |
| Opportunity regrouping | a transaction-scoped advisory lock |
| A person's read-modify-write use cases (feedback, preferences, imports) | a per-account advisory lock (the local store uses a process mutex) |
| Profile writers | the same optimistic revision as locally, checked under the profile row's lock (`Conflict` on a lost race) |
| Private change order | the account row's lock and change sequence |
| Worker runs | `worker_runs` rows (start, end, outcome, counts); runs left `running` by a dead worker are closed as abandoned |

## Observability and usage events

- **Logs**: JSON lines on stderr (`JOBHUNT_LOG` for the filter). Every
  request has a span with `request_id`, method, the route *template*,
  the internal account id once authenticated, status and duration.
  Bodies, query strings, `Authorization` and cookies are never logged;
  neither are resumes, contacts, reasons, preference text or tokens.
  Workers log counts per run and per source.
- **Usage events** (`usage_events`, separate from product data): `login`,
  `logout`, `sync_pull`, `sync_push`, `find`, `verify`, `feedback`,
  `preferences`, `token_created`, `mcp_tool` — with the account id and
  small safe metadata (counts, the tool name, whether a reason was given,
  never the reason). They are written in batches off the request path
  (dropped rather than slowing a request when the writer is behind), can
  be turned off (`JOBHUNT_USAGE_EVENTS=false`), and are deleted with the
  account. `jobhunt admin status` summarizes the last 7 days.

## Deploying on Railway

Railway's `railway.json` / `railway.toml` config-as-code is deprecated
(new services cannot use it); the deployment is described as
Infrastructure as Code in [`.railway/railway.ts`](../.railway/railway.ts):
a Postgres database, the `api` service (`jobhunt server`, pre-deploy
`jobhunt migrate`, healthcheck `/ready`, 30 s draining on SIGTERM), and
two cron services for the workers. All services build the repository's
[`Dockerfile`](../Dockerfile) (a multi-stage build; Railpack's Rust
provider assumes the binary is named like its package, which is not the
case here).

First deployment:

1. Install the tools: Node 22.6+ and the Railway CLI (5.42+), then
   `npm install` at the repository root (it only installs the `railway`
   IaC package).
2. `railway login`, `railway init` (or `railway link` to an existing
   project and environment).
3. Review and apply: `railway config plan`, then `railway config apply`.
4. Set the hand-managed variables on the `api` service (then seal the
   secret ones in the dashboard):

   ```bash
   railway variable set -s api \
     JOBHUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEYS="k1:$(openssl rand -base64 32)" \
     JOBHUNT_OIDC_ISSUER=https://<subdomain>.authkit.app \
     JOBHUNT_OIDC_AUDIENCE="https://<api domain>,https://<api domain>/mcp" \
     JOBHUNT_OIDC_CLI_CLIENT_ID=<the CLI application's client id> \
     JOBHUNT_PUBLIC_URL=https://<api domain>
   ```

5. Give `api` a public domain (`railway domain -s api`, or a custom
   domain); generated domains are not managed by the IaC file.
6. In the identity provider. For WorkOS AuthKit:
   - enable at least one sign-in method (Magic Auth, Google, GitHub, …);
   - under the OAuth resources (resource indicators), add
     `https://<api domain>` (the CLI's, as default) and
     `https://<api domain>/mcp` (MCP clients');
   - optionally enable dynamic client registration, so MCP clients can
     sign in with OAuth instead of a personal access token.

   - create a **public OAuth application** for the CLI (Applications →
     OAuth, public client, no secret) and use its client id as
     `JOBHUNT_OIDC_CLI_CLIENT_ID`; AuthKit's device endpoint refuses the
     environment's own client id (`invalid_client`).

   For Auth0 instead: an API
   whose identifier is the audience, a native application with the device
   code grant and refresh token rotation, and
   `JOBHUNT_OIDC_AUDIENCE_PARAMETER=audience`.
7. Deploy (pushes to `main`, or `railway up`), then
   [validate](#validating-a-deployment).

Applying the IaC file deletes variables it does not list; every
hand-managed variable is listed with `preserve()` so it survives.

Cost: one small always-on `api` service, two cron services that run for
minutes per hour and exit, and one Postgres. Pool sizes are small
(`api` 10 connections, workers 4) to stay far below Postgres's default
100 connections.

## Configuration reference

Cloud processes read environment variables only (plus `JOBHUNT_CONFIG`).
`jobhunt admin status` shows each as set, missing or invalid — never a
secret's value. Invalid or missing required values stop the process at
startup with every problem listed.

| Variable | Used by | Required | Default / notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `DATABASE_URL` | all | yes | `${{Postgres.DATABASE_URL}}` (private network). Secret. |
| `JOBHUNT_ENCRYPTION_KEYS` | server, `admin reencrypt` | yes | `<id>:<base64 32 bytes>[,…]`; first encrypts. Secret. |
| `JOBHUNT_OIDC_ISSUER` | server | yes (OIDC) | the provider's issuer URL, exactly as in its tokens |
| `JOBHUNT_OIDC_AUDIENCE` | server | yes (OIDC) | the accepted `aud` values, comma separated; the first is the one the CLI asks for |
| `JOBHUNT_OIDC_AUDIENCE_PARAMETER` | server | no | how the CLI asks for it: `resource` (RFC 8707, default), `audience` (Auth0) or `none` |
| `JOBHUNT_OIDC_CLI_CLIENT_ID` | server | for CLI login | the public client of the device flow |
| `JOBHUNT_OIDC_SCOPES` | server | no | `openid offline_access` |
| `JOBHUNT_OIDC_JWKS_URL` | server | no | the provider's keys, for providers without metadata (skips discovery) |
| `JOBHUNT_OIDC_DEVICE_AUTHORIZATION_URL`, `_TOKEN_URL`, `_REVOCATION_URL` | server | no | endpoints the provider's metadata lacks (each overrides it) |
| `JOBHUNT_AUTH_MODE` | server | no | `oidc`; `dev` for development only (refused in production) |
| `JOBHUNT_AUTH_DEV_SECRET` | server | with `dev` | 32+ characters |
| `JOBHUNT_PUBLIC_URL` | server | in production | the https URL clients use; falls back to `https://$RAILWAY_PUBLIC_DOMAIN` |

session is stored, `JOBHUNT_TOKEN` for `login --token`.

## Validating a deployment

After the first deploy (the commands a person with access to the project
runs; nothing here was run against Railway from this repository):

```bash
API=https://<api domain>
curl -fsS $API/health                          # {"status":"ok",…}
curl -fsS $API/ready                           # {"status":"ready","database":"ok","schema":"current"}
curl -fsS $API/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource/mcp
railway logs -s api --since 10m                # "JobHunt Cloud listening", migrations applied

# An account, and sync
jobhunt login --server $API                    # device sign-in in the browser
jobhunt account
jobhunt init resume.pdf && jobhunt sync        # the profile goes up
jobhunt sync --status

# Workers, on demand
railway run -s worker-discovery jobhunt worker discovery      # or trigger the cron in the dashboard
railway run -s worker-verification jobhunt worker verification
railway ssh -s api -- jobhunt admin status     # schedule, schema, usage

# Stored jobs and an authenticated request
TOKEN=$(jobhunt token create validation --days 1 | tail -1)
curl -fsS -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"limit":3}' $API/api/v1/search
# MCP: point an MCP client at $API/mcp with the token (or OAuth)
jobhunt token revoke <tok_…>
```

(`railway run` runs locally with the service's variables; the private
`DATABASE_URL` does not resolve outside Railway, so use
`DATABASE_PUBLIC_URL` locally or `railway ssh` into the service.)

## Known limitations

- Sync is explicit (`jobhunt sync`); mutations are not pushed
  automatically, and there are no server-pushed updates to the CLI.
- A pull brings the jobs your feedback and recent cloud recommendations
  refer to; the rest of the corpus is searched in the cloud, not copied.
  A cloud-closed job already stored on the laptop is updated by the
  laptop's own discovery or verification, not by sync.
- A conflict that would leave the profile inconsistent stops the whole
  profile part of a sync (feedback still syncs) until resolved with
  `--keep`.
- Ranking runs per request over every open opportunity in the shared
  corpus (batched reads); with a much larger corpus it will need
  precomputation for active users.
- The OS keychain is used on macOS and Windows; on Linux the session is an
  owner-only file (Secret Service support would need D-Bus).
- MCP clients that cannot do OAuth need a personal access token.
- There is no per-account rate limiting yet (request bodies are capped at
  16 MB and requests time out after 120 s); a search's verification is
  bounded (at most 12 candidates) and verifications are shared.
- "Log out everywhere" takes effect within 30 seconds on other replicas
  (identities are cached that long); personal access tokens record their
  last use on every request.
- Usage events are basic counts for operating the beta, not an analytics
  product; there is no dashboard.
- Not built here (BRU-295/296): web UI, hosted feed, notifications,
  billing and plans, application assistance.
